The first script would print hello world
The second script would print a confused smiley
The third script would print the contents of the /etc/passwd file
The fourth script would print the contents of the /etc/passwd and the /etc/hosts files
The fifth script would print the last ten files/entries of the /etc/passwd file
The sixth script would print the first ten lines of the /etc/passwd file
The seventh script would print only the third line of the iacta file
